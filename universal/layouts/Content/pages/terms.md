- Effective Date: November 30, 2016
- Last Revised: November 30, 2016

### Who we are and what this Agreement does

Please read this Terms and Conditions Agreement (“**Agreement**”)
carefully, which is a legal contract between you (“**User**”) and Thrive
Global Holdings, Inc. (“**Thrive Global**”, “**we**”, or “**us**”). This
Agreement sets out the terms and conditions upon which we allow you to
use our websites located at <https://www.thriveglobal.com/>,
<https://shop.thriveglobal.com/>, and <https://journal.thriveglobal.com/>, and any mobile applications associated therewith (collectively,
the **“Sites”**). By accessing or using the Sites, accessing or using
any content, information, services, features or resources available or

### Changes to this Agreement

Please note that this Agreement is subject to change by Thrive Global in
its sole discretion at any time. When changes are made, we will make a
new copy of this Agreement available on the Sites. We will also update
the “Last Revised” date at the top of the Agreement. If we make any
material changes, and you have registered with us to create an Account,
we will also send an e-mail to you at the last e-mail address you
provided to us pursuant to this Agreement. Any changes to the Agreement
will be effective immediately for new Users and will be effective thirty
(30) days after posting notice of such changes on the Sites for existing
Users, provided that any material changes shall be effective for Users
who have an Account with us upon the earlier of thirty (30) days after
posting notice of such changes on the Sites or thirty (30) days after
dispatch of an e-mail notice to Registered Users. If you do not agree to
any changes after receiving a notice of such changes, you shall stop
using the Services. Your continued use of the Sites and/or Services
constitutes your acceptance of such changes. Please regularly check the
Sites to view the then-current Agreement.

    previous credit card dispute.

of reselling.

agreement and not this Agreement to determine your rights
and liabilities. By providing us with your credit card number
and associated payment information, you agree that we are
authorized to immediately invoice your Account for all fees and
charges due and payable to Thrive Global hereunder and that no
additional notice or consent is required. You agree to

its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, employees, agents,

use, the Services; (c) your violation of this Agreement; (d) your

Thrive Global in asserting any available defenses. This provision
does not require you to indemnify any of the Thrive Global Parties
for any unconscionable commercial practice by such party or for such
party’s fraud, deception, false promise, misrepresentation or
concealment, suppression or omission of any material fact in
connection with the Sites, Application, or any Services
provided hereunder. You agree that the provisions in this section
will survive any termination of your Account, the Agreement or your
access to the Services.

This Agreement commences on the date you accept them
and remain in full force and effect while you use the Services,
unless terminated earlier in accordance with this Agreement.

### 13.2 Termination.
If you have materially breached any provision
of the Agreement, if we are required to do so by law (e.g.,
where the provision of any of the Services is, or becomes,
unlawful), or if we choose to discontinue the Services (in whole
or in part), we have the right to, immediately and without
notice, suspend or terminate any the Services provided to you.
If we become aware of any possible violations by you of the
Agreement, we reserve the right to investigate such violations.
In the event that we determine, in our sole discretion, that you
have breached any portion of the Agreement, or have otherwise
demonstrated inappropriate conduct, we reserve the right to (i)
warn you via e-mail (to any e-mail address you have provided
to us) that you have violated the Agreement; (ii) notify and/or
fully cooperate with the proper law enforcement authorities for
further action; and/or (iii) pursue any other action which we

to refer the matter to, and to cooperate with, any and all
applicable legal authorities. We are entitled, except to the
extent prohibited by applicable law, to disclose any data,
content, or other information on or in the Services in our

comply with applicable laws, legal process or governmental
request; (b) enforce the Agreement; (c) respond to your requests

disclaimers, and limitation of liability.

### 13.4 No Subsequent Registration.
If your registration(s) with

to you.

## 14. International Users.
The Services can be accessed from countries
around the world and may contain references to Services and Content
that are not available in your country. These references do not
imply that Thrive Global intends to announce such Services or
Content in your country. The Services are controlled and offered by
Thrive Global from its facilities in the United States of America.
Thrive Global makes no representations that the Services are
appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who
access or use the Services from other countries do so at their own
volition and are responsible for compliance with local law.

## 15. Dispute Resolution.
*Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (“**Arbitration Agreement**”) carefully.  It requires you to arbitrate disputes with Thrive Global and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.*

### 15.1 Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.
You agree that any
dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of
the Services, to any products sold or distributed through the
Sites, or to any aspect of your relationship with Thrive Global,
will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court,
except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if
your claims qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court
and advances only on an individual
(non-class, non-representative) basis; and (2) you or Thrive
Global may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or
other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as
trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets,
copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration Agreement shall
apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were
asserted before the Effective Date of this Agreement or any
prior version of this Agreement.

### 15.2 Arbitration Rules and Forum.
The Federal Arbitration Act
governs the interpretation and enforcement of this
Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you
must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your
claim to <commerce@thriveglobal.com>. The arbitration will be
conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution
provider.   Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under
\$250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall
be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined
Arbitration Rules and procedures available at
<http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/>; all
other claims shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of
the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at
<http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/>.
JAMS’s rules are also available at
[www.jamsadr.com](http://www.jamsadr.com) or by calling JAMS
at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the
parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the
arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing,
administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a
waiver from JAMS, Thrive Global will pay them for you. In
addition, Thrive Global will reimburse all such JAMS’s filing,
administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims totaling
less than \$10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims
are frivolous. Likewise, Thrive Global will not seek attorneys’
fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines
the claims are frivolous.

You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone,
based on written submissions, or in person in the country where
you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on
the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court
of competent jurisdiction.

### 15.3 Authority of Arbitrator.
The arbitrator, and not any
federal, state or local court or agency shall have exclusive
authority to resolve any dispute related to the interpretation,
applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration
Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or
any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The
arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of
you and Thrive Global. The arbitration proceeding will not be
consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other
cases or parties.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to
grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The
arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages
and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an
individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and
the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The
arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision
describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the
award is based, including the calculation of any damages
awarded.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief
on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would
have.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you
and us. 

### 15.4 Waiver of Jury Trial.
You and Thrive Global hereby waive
any constitutional and statutory rights to sue in court and have
a trial in front of a judge or jury. You and Thrive Global are
instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved
by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as
specified in Section 15.1 above.  An arbitrator can award on an
individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must
follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no
judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration
award is subject to very limited review.  

### 15.4 Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.
