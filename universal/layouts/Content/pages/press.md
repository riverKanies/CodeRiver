# Arianna Huffington Launches Thrive Global to End the Escalating Stress and Burnout Epidemic with Sustainable, Science-Based Solutions
#### *Thrive Global announces international partnerships with The Times Group of India, Italy’s Gruppo Espresso, South Africa’s Discovery and its global Vitality Network and Antenna Group in Greece, Eastern Europe, Turkey and Russia*

NEW YORK (November 30, 2016) -- Today, Thrive Global, Arianna Huffington’s new and groundbreaking venture, has launched. The company aims to revolutionize the way we work and live by offering companies and individuals science-based solutions to lower stress and burnout, and enhance well-being and productivity.

*“We are at an inflection point in history where technology has granted us powers that accelerate the speed of life beyond our capacity to cope,” said Arianna Huffington, Founder and CEO of Thrive Global. “Thrive Global is born in response to this need to take control of our lives and offer new strategies and tools, based on the latest science, to address the unintended consequences of these profound and invasive changes.”*

After disrupting the world of media in 2005 with the launch of The Huffington Post, Arianna is now disrupting the way we work and live both at the corporate and individual levels with the rapidly expanding Thrive Global organization, based in New York City.

### International Partnerships
Since stress and burnout and our relationship to technology are problems across the world, Thrive Global is global from day one. In India, Thrive Global is partnering with The Times Group, India's largest media company, to enter the Indian market, scale its business and advance its mission. The Times Group, which publishes The Times of India, the world's most widely-circulated English-language newspaper, has previously invested in and partnered with Uber, Airbnb, Coursera, Vice, The Huffington Post and others via its global investment arm Times Global Partners.

In Italy, Thrive Global is launching in partnership with the Digital Division of Gruppo Espresso, one of Italy’s leading publishing groups operating in all sectors of communication, from dailies and magazines to radio, the internet and advertising.

The company is also partnering in South Africa with Discovery and its global Vitality Network – the pioneer in Shared-Value – which will make Thrive offerings available through its global insurance partners and corporate clients in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Thailand, United Kingdom and United States. *"This partnership is another advancement in our global mission to make people healthier and enhance and protect their lives,”* said  Discovery Founder and Chief Executive Adrian Gore. *”Overcoming stress and burnout are key factors in managing overall health and wellbeing -- with Thrive Global we’ll be able to offer the latest research and tools to our global Vitality network of over 4 million members in 14 countries worldwide.”*

Antenna Group, an international media and entertainment organization with leading positions across Europe, North America and Australia, is partnering with Thrive Global to bring the venture to major markets across Central and Eastern Europe. Through its AMPLIFIER unit, Antenna Group is the go-to partner for digital global companies such as Thrive Global looking to expand into previously hard-to-reach markets such as Eastern Europe. Antenna Group partnered with VICE Media in 2014 and together the partners have carved out a significant reach for VICE’s content across a range of media platforms in Eastern Europe, especially amongst the youth audience.

“Thrive Global will have a great impact on how we work and live and we’re incredibly excited to be working with Arianna and her team to help achieve their global ambitions,” said Theodore Kyriakou, shareholder and chief executive of Antenna Group. “We set up the AMPLIFIER unit to do exciting work with innovative companies just like Thrive Global and our decision to work together is a testament to the strong track record of growing profitable, digital businesses in the region. What would normally take five years for a company to achieve in these regions, our AMPLIFIER unit can help them do in a year.”

Antenna Group, which has offices in Amsterdam, London, Athens and New York, operates a wide network of media assets including television channels, digital channels, radio stations and content production facilities. Through its partnership with the global merchant bank Raine Group, the company has also invested in a number of global media companies, including recently Imagine Entertainment.

Though burnout is a global epidemic and the modern science about well-being and productivity is universal, the solutions Thrive Global brings to different regions will be rooted in the philosophy and ancient wisdom of those regions and cultures.

### Corporate Partnerships
Corporate leaders around the world are increasingly aware of the direct connection between the bottom line and employee well-being, resilience, engagement, and sense of purpose. Thrive Global partners with companies around the world to deliver customized workshops, ongoing coaching and technology in order to create a thriving corporate culture. Its launch partners include Accenture, Airbnb, Glassdoor, JPMorgan Chase, SAP and Uber.

Thrive Global is teaming with Accenture to support the company’s ongoing commitment to employee well-being. This includes interactive live workshops delivered in the US, India, Ireland, Argentina and Japan -- each of which is customized for local cultures and customs -- as well as personal assessments, ongoing coaching, and weekly tips designed to help individuals take micro steps for macro benefits. “We are committed to being the most truly human organization, where our people can be successful both professionally and personally,” said Ellyn Shook, Accenture’s chief leadership and human resources officer. “Teaming with Thrive Global is an important step forward in advancing our focus on the whole person – helping our people not only achieve a sense of belonging and purpose, but be physically energized and mentally focused in our hyper connected, digital world.”

Thrive Global and Airbnb will bring Thrive’s science-based, whole-human well-being approach to the Airbnb “Work Like a Human” initiative, in an effort to help people live more fulfilling, productive lives both at home and at work. The effort will kick off in 2017 with Airbnb employee trainings.

Thrive Global and Glassdoor, the leading job search site that also offers job seekers access to company reviews, ratings and salary data for more than 600,000 companies, are partnering in the following key ways: The two companies will collaborate to evaluate and release a co-branded Thrive Index based on employees’ assessments of how their employer incorporates meaningful “thrive” practices into their workplaces and cultures.  As an initial step, as of today, Thrive and Glassdoor are encouraging employers to *Pledge to Thrive* to show they are committed to prioritizing employee well-being. Any employer may promote their Pledge on their company’s Glassdoor profile page and job listings to showcase their commitment to job seekers and employees. Glassdoor is also a Thrive Global launch partner for editorial content and will regularly contribute relevant articles and bylines from both the employer and employee points of view on the new Glassdoor channel on *Thrive’s media platform*. *“As an employer and as a growing platform where employers actively recruit candidates and manage their employer brands, Glassdoor recognizes the value of helping employees thrive inside and outside of work,”* said Robert Hohman, co-founder and CEO of Glassdoor. *“Jobs are more than paychecks. Today’s top talent want to work for a company with a strong mission and purpose where they feel like they can make a difference and where they believe they are supported not just professionally, but personally with a meaningful life outside of work. At Glassdoor our mission is simple: to help people find a job and company they love, and we are delighted to join with Arianna and the Thrive Global team in our shared commitment to help employees and employers thrive by promoting and sustaining employee well-being.”*

JPMorgan Chase is partnering with Thrive Global as the company focuses its attention on employee emotional well-being around the world. JPMorgan will work with Thrive to offer resources for employees and increase awareness about the dangers of burnout through an internal communications campaign. The partnership has launched with a four-week interactive well-being challenge to provide employees with tips and resources in four key areas – sleep, unplugging from technology, mindfulness and gratitude. *“What we love about Thrive Global is that it gives our employees tools to improve both their physical and mental wellness,"* said JPMorgan Chase Chief Marketing Officer Kristin Lemkau. “Most people are aware of how important physical fitness and nutrition are, but we are still behind in understanding how important sleep, unplugging and mindfulness are. Arianna and Thrive will help us with that.”

As part of a global content partnership, Thrive Global will integrate its science-driven, action-oriented content with SAP’s human capital management suite – SAP SuccessFactors – which is used by 45 million people worldwide. Thrive content will be categorized for SAP SuccessFactors users by themes, including wisdom, wonder, well-being, giving, productivity and technology. *“There’s no more important leadership topic than the future of work and the workforce itself,”* said Jennifer Morgan, President of SAP North America. *“The future of work will be shaped by those who can keep their employees healthy, vibrant, and engaged in new and dynamic ways with the same caliber of quality content they’ve come to expect as consumers and readers – and SAP is thrilled to be breaking new ground in this area with Thrive Global.”*                           
        
Thrive Global and Uber have partnered to develop a scalable, data-driven approach to creating a productive, thriving culture in the fast-growing start-up environment. Together, the two companies will develop an interactive employee learning program that will launch in early 2017, empowering Uber’s 9,000+ global employees with the tools and techniques to identify and manage work productivity in their individual roles.

*"When you run a global business that never sleeps, often you don’t either. I used to think it made me tough not to get much sleep,"* said Travis Kalanick, CEO of Uber. *"Luckily, I had a good friend who made me to rethink my relationship with rest — and I've been a lot happier and more productive ever since. So when Arianna started Thrive Global to change the way people live and work, I immediately asked how everyone at Uber could participate. Today Uber is proud to be one of the first companies to partner with Thrive Global to help our employees get the most out of their time in and out of the office."*

Thrive Global is partnering with Adam Grant and The Wharton School to measure the impact of its work with corporations. *"We’re thrilled to be working with Thrive around practices for promoting employee well-being—and measuring their impact on productivity and the bottom line,"* said Adam Grant, PhD, Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. *"Our jobs should be energizing, not exhausting. It’s time to accelerate a culture shift from burned out to fired up."*

### Non-Profit Partnerships
Thrive Global launches with a foundation which is offering free trainings to leaders of non-profits, as well as civic leaders who are on the front lines of serving others. Those who have already received training or who are scheduled to include Alliance for Children's Rights, EduCare Foundation, Global Citizen, Global Health Corps, Khan Academy, LeanIn.Org as well as the mayors and mayoral staffs of Minneapolis, Oakland and Providence and the Mayor of Boston and the City of Boston’s 18,000+ employees.

*“I’m thrilled to be partnering with Arianna and everyone at Thrive Global as this important work launches, said Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges. “I’m living proof that it is completely possible to be in a high-powered executive function and take care of yourself. I lend my voice to the chorus that says you will be more effective in your work and happier in your life if you take the risk of self-care. Arianna has been an inspiration to me and so many others, and I look forward to seeing the vision of Thrive Global become a reality, and make a real difference in people’s lives.”* Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf said: *“It’s critical that we begin the practice of putting self-care, health and wellbeing at the top of Americans’ to-do lists. Under Arianna Huffington’s leadership, Thrive Global will help businesses better serve their employees and their shareholders by creating a better-balanced workforce that is healthier, happier, and more creatively productive.”* Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza said: “Here in Providence, we are excited to get involved with Thrive Global and appreciate their focus on maintaining strong and sustainable work-life balance for our employees. I have seen firsthand the hard work that non-profit and public sectors employees put into their work and I know that providing them with resources and trainings they need is critical to supporting their quality of life both at work and at home.” Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said: *"The City of Boston is focused on providing a healthy, balanced and sustainable quality of life for all its employees. I'm looking forward to working together with Thrive Global to provide their work/life balance training to all of our hard-working City employees throughout Boston."*

### Media Platform
The second pillar of Thrive Global is its media platform, which will serve as the global hub for the well-being and performance conversation, with an emphasis on action and change. It features original video content, the latest science, expert commentary and community contributions. To make it easy for users to take action and see immediate progress, included in the stories will be recommended microsteps – small changes that, over time and taken together, can deliver dramatic results. The media platform also functions as a sustainability arm for all corporate trainings, and will be continuously updated with new features, such as social and peer networks called Thrive Tribes, launching in early 2017.

Thrive Global is using Medium to power its media site, which will be home to original and curated stories from Thrive's editorial staff, and diverse perspectives from contributors and content partners. *“We welcome Thrive to Medium, and look forward to seeing them enrich the conversation around well-being, productivity and the science behind success,”* said Ev Williams, Medium Founder and CEO. *“Arianna brings with her a deep understanding of the media landscape and how it has evolved in the last decade. We’re excited to discover how that expertise shapes Thrive’s direction on Medium.”*

Thrive Global’s media platform launches with contributions from business leaders, athletes, politicians, entertainers and world-renowned scientists and researchers. Some of the first voices you’ll hear from include Sheryl Sandberg, Russell Wilson, Tufts University Director of Center for Reading and Language Research Maryanne Wolf, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Duke Professor Murali Doraiswamy, Ohio State University Professor Ali Rezai and Anne-Marie Slaughter and more, who share their stories of health and well-being in first person pieces or videos. The media platform also introduces The Thrive Global Questionnaire, in which influencers ranging from Jeff Bezos, Howard Schultz and Brian Grazer to Selena Gomez, Priyanka Chopra, Shane Smith, Valerie Jarrett, and Ashton Kutcher share their well-being and productivity habits.

Other Thrive Global media partners include NowThis, VICE, iHeartMedia, and The New York Times. Thrive Global and millennial news brand NowThis are launching their partnership with a video series called *“Turning Point,”* which puts the spotlight on millennial women who experienced a burnout wake-up call and made a positive change in their lives as a result.

Thrive Global is partnering with Tonic, VICE's new channel dedicated to health and wellness, to jointly create a mental health index for college campuses that will help young people better understand one of the most important issues they and their friends may face. VICE and Thrive will also launch a global conversation about mortality and life's biggest questions in partnership with the not-for-profit Death Over Dinner. In addition, Thrive and the VICE Brand Studio will introduce a video series focused on high-performance athletes and their daily and nightly routines. The premier episode features NBA all-star Andre Iguodala, who credits his improved performance on the court to changes in his sleep habits.

*"Arianna is an inspiration and a leader in the digital media landscape and her Sleep Revolution has made a huge impact on my life on and off court,"* said NBA finals MVP and Thrive Global Partner Andre Iguodala. *"Bringing health and wellness to the forefront in our everyday life is a terrific concept and will allow everyone to reach their full potential. Thrive Global is an innovative and life changing initiative that I'm extremely excited to be a part of."*

Thrive Global and iHeartMedia will launch The Thrive Global Podcast with iHeartRadio in January 2017. Arianna will host the podcast, which will feature interviews with notable leaders, celebrities, athletes and influencers who will discuss how they thrive. Listeners can hear the bi-weekly series via iHeartRadio, iHeartMedia’s digital music and streaming radio service, as well as on thriveglobal.com and they can hear the teaser episode on iHeartRadio, which is now available on 90 unique device platforms spanning in-home entertainment, wearables, gaming, mobile and auto. *“We are excited to help Arianna bring the Thrive message to more than a quarter of a billion iHeartMedia listeners on-air and in app,”* said Gayle Troberman, Chief Marketing Officer of iHeartMedia. *“Everything sound is hot. Radio, streaming, concerts and podcasts are all on the rise, and we expect the Thrive Global Podcast will be an instant hit with iHeartRadio listeners."*

In addition, Thrive Global is working with T- Brand studio, The New York Times's in-house brand marketing unit, to produce native advertising campaigns for Thrive Global partners.

The media platform includes a six week e-course, hosted by Arianna Huffington, which helps consumers move from surviving to thriving by using scientifically proven methods to decrease stress and burnout and improve overall health, performance, and happiness.

Thrive Global is launching with a branded content partnership with the Quaker Oats Company — a year-long campaign that focuses on making mornings more joyful and productive. *“For nearly 140 years, Quaker has stood as a symbol for quality, great taste and nutrition,”* said Morgan Flatley, Chief Marketing Officer, PepsiCo Global Nutrition Group and Senior Vice President, Global Grains. *“We share in Thrive’s principle that micro-steps are an easily adoptable path to change and through this partnership, we look forward to bringing more of that oat goodness and nutritional value to people around the world in ways that educate, entertain and entice.”*

### Technology

Core to a Thrive culture shift is addressing our relationship with technology. Our technology improves our lives on a daily basis, but on a long-term basis we’re losing the ability to regulate and manage this increasingly powerful and addictive new element in our lives to serve our best interests. This is the background for Thrive Global’s partnership with Bennett Miller, the Academy Award-nominated director of Moneyball, who also has a documentary coming out soon on our troubled relationship with technology. To begin re-calibrating that relationship, we’ve created an app called Silo. Putting a phone into “Silo Mode” means turning our smartphones into dumb phones for a specified period of time, with only emergency calls or texts allowed to get through. By selectively blocking distractions, Silo allows you to reclaim space in your life for focus, creativity, and well-being.

Silo is the first step in a campaign to change our relationship with technology and make disconnecting not only an option but a regular part of our daily lives. *"The Silo app is a great idea. Our lives are getting overwhelmed by interruptions and notifications, which makes it hard to focus on the things that really matter around you,"* said Christian Plagemann, Director of Udacity Blitz. *"The ability to take a digital break with confidence can be truly impactful. Our Udacity Blitz mobile engineering team worked closely with the Thrive Product Engineering team to make this idea a reality — and we are delighted with the result.”*
 
Thrive Global will also be introducing Thrive Away, a vacation email tool that, by deleting your incoming emails while you’re away, allows you to truly disconnect and recharge. Thrive Away's insight is simple: the key is never seeing the email, while also letting the sender know when you’ll be back.

### Commerce Platform

Thrive Global’s commerce platform offers a curated selection of the best technology and products – including newly developed Thrive products — for well-being and performance. Thrive Global has launched its signature product, The Phone Bed, which is the world’s first family bed for devices. The charging station — which charges up to ten devices at a time — helps the whole family get a better night’s sleep by putting all devices to bed outside the bedroom.

Thrive Global is collaborating with Amazon on an Alexa skill, Power Down, to help customers incorporate well-being activities into their everyday lives – just in time for the busy holiday season. The Power Down skill helps customers relax before sleep with guided meditation. Starting November 30, Alexa device owners can enable the skill by saying, “Alexa, enable the Thrive skill.” Once enabled, customers can start their Power Down meditation by saying, *“Alexa, open Thrive,”* or *“Alexa, ask Thrive for a Power Down.” “The holiday season can sometimes be stressful with family to host, presents to buy and parties to attend, so we’re excited to collaborate with Ariana Huffington and Thrive to offer customers a way to escape the busyness and focus on their well-being,”* said Steve Rabuchin, Vice President, Amazon Alexa. *“The Thrive skill complements other Alexa capabilities – like timers, to do lists and smart home — to help make customers’ lives easier and more balanced year round.”*

Arianna and Thrive Global have joined forces with Audible, the world’s largest producer of downloadable audiobooks and other spoken word entertainment, to create *“Goodnight Smartphone,”* a timely and soothing parody of the beloved children’s book *"Goodnight Moon"* that encourages listeners to eliminate distractions at bedtime in favor of better sleep. The story, which Arianna narrates, will be available as a free download exclusively at Audible this January.

These are principles that serve as the foundation for both Pour Les Femmes and Thrive Global, and we couldn’t be more excited to partner with them.”*

We know that in home massage from Zeel will be a valuable part of the Thrive Global solution, helping people thrive, not just survive."*

### Thrive Global Pop-Up Store
In addition to visiting e-commerce at shop.thriveglobal.com, consumers can do their holiday shopping at the Thrive Global retail pop-up store in New York City.

Led by Jason Jones and Mimi Eayrs, JWP designed the pop-up store and integrated all partner brands and aligned organizations into the experimental retail space.

To build out the pop-up store, Thrive Global formed a partnership with The New School’s Parson’s School of Design and Parsons Board of Governors Chair Kay Unger. Under Unger’s leadership, Parsons, one of the leading institutions for art and design education, created two installations in the Thrive Global store. Room to Daydream is a space to nap and recharge, created by Parsons’ Healthy Materials Lab. The second installation, Resonance, uses light to spread the image of participants infinitely in two directions — into the past and future — as they move within the work. Christian Swafford and Lauren Larson, founders of Material Lust, showcase their Crepuscule Floor Lamp and Lancia Floor Lamp.

The Sleep Sanctuary, an integral installation in Thrive Global’s pop-up store, was developed by COCO-MAT Sleep On Nature, an international bedding company which focuses on creating the highest quality metal free beds, mattresses and bedding accessories handcrafted solely from natural materials and produced through sustainable methods, in partnership with The Lionesque Group.
