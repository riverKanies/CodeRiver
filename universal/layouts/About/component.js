    `Recent science has shown that the pervasive belief that burnout is the price
     we must pay for success is a delusion. We know, instead, that when we prioritize
     our well-being, our decision-making, creativity and productivity improve
     dramatically.`,
    `Thrive Global's three interconnected core components are: corporate trainings
     and workshops that bring the latest strategies and tools around health and
     well-being to organizations; a media platform that serves as the global hub
     for the conversation about well-being and performance with an emphasis on
     action; and, an e-commerce platform that offers a curated selection of the best
     technology and products for well-being. Together, the three components create
     an integrated platform that empowers people to make sustainable changes to
     their daily lives, going from knowing what to do to actually doing it.`,
    `Thrive Global is committed to accelerating the culture shift that allows
     people to reclaim their lives and move from surviving to thriving.`
